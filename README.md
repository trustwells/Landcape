# Landcape


One of my first project ever in my first introductory computer science class here at UNL. Basically just uses an array along with some ASCII commands. This is meant to run in the terminal. 

Requires 3 system argument inputs i.e. python landscape.py 2 2 2

Generates a random map similar to minecraft and you can replicate the same one with the same system argument if you wanted.
